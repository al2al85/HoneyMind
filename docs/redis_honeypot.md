# Redis Honeypot

## HoneyMind Status

This document is kept as a legacy note from the upstream ThalesGroup dd-honeypot codebase. Redis support is not part of the current supported HoneyMind deployment path.

HoneyMind currently focuses on the SSH honeypot, local JSONL logs, the web analysis dashboard, and optional Grafana monitoring. Treat the Redis handler and examples below as experimental until they are revalidated and documented as a first-class HoneyMind feature.

The Redis honeypot emulates a realistic Redis server. It captures commands, maintains in-memory state, and responds to common administrative and keyspace commands. It supports the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP) and integrates with a dataset or LLM for fallback responses.

## Features

-   **Stateful Storage**: Remembers keys set during the session (in-memory).
-   **Multi-Database**: Supports `SELECT` to switch between isolated databases (DB 0, DB 1, etc.).
-   **Authentication**: Accepts `AUTH` commands (logs the password, always allows access).
-   **Keyspace Management**: Supports `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, and `KEYS` (listing keys).
-   **Server Info**: Provides a realistic, dynamic `INFO` response (uptime, memory, etc.).
-   **Fallback**: Uses `data.jsonl` or an LLM for commands not natively implemented.

## Configuration

To run the Redis honeypot, you need a folder containing a `config.json` and a `data.jsonl` file.

### config.json

```json
{
  "name": "redis_honeypot",
  "type": "redis",
  "port": 6379,
  "data_file": "data.jsonl",
  "system_prompt": "You are a Redis server. Respond to commands in the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP) format. For example, for a simple string response, start with '+', for an error '-', for an integer ':', and for bulk strings '$'. If the user asks for keys or data that doesn't exist, return a null bulk string '$-1\\r\\n'. Mimic a standard Redis instance.",
  "model_id": "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0"
}
```

### data.jsonl

The dataset maps commands to responses. Note that the key for the input is `command`.

```json lines
{"command": "PING", "response": "+PONG\\r\\n"}
```

## Running the Honeypot

You can run the honeypot using the `honeypot_main.py` script, pointing it to your configuration folder.

```bash
# Assuming you are in the root of the repo
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/src
python3 src/honeypot_main.py test/honeypots/redis
```

## Testing

You can test the honeypot using `redis-cli` to verify its realistic behavior.

### Example Session

```bash
$ redis-cli -p 6379
127.0.0.1:6379> PING
PONG
127.0.0.1:6379> AUTH supersecret
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> SET user:1 "Alice"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> SET user:2 "Bob"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> KEYS *
1) "user:1"
2) "user:2"
127.0.0.1:6379> GET user:1
"Alice"
127.0.0.1:6379> DEL user:1
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> KEYS *
1) "user:2"
127.0.0.1:6379> SELECT 1
OK
127.0.0.1:6379[1]> KEYS *
(empty array)
127.0.0.1:6379[1]> SET secret "hidden"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379[1]> SELECT 0
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> KEYS *
1) "user:2"
127.0.0.1:6379> SELECT 1
OK
127.0.0.1:6379[1]> GET secret
"hidden"
127.0.0.1:6379[1]> INFO

### Using Netcat (nc)

If you don't have `redis-cli`, you can use `nc`.

```bash
printf "PING\r\n" | nc localhost 6379
```
